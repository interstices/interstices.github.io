*Tendrils* is a book which opens up new worlds, layer by layer. Set in Prague, Munich and the Czech countryside, it weaves together two stories of departure and return. Ochre is an artist who is trying to piece together a lost friendship from the time before 1989 and the messages from his pocket-knife; Zuzi and Alena grow in the Moravian countryside, struggling to make sense of the fragments of their family stories and of their own future. If you have ever written a letter and not sent it, Tendrils will turn out to be about you.
