"Travel-writing might be 19th-century, but traveling itself is at best 20th-century. My bet would be that it will soon be over. People already mostly travel because they have to, or feel they have to. It is for work – because you have a board meeting overseas or because you want to make it to Europe to find a living –, and more often it is for war. And soon it will be for draught and flooding. Not having to migrate, having a place intact enough to be able to stay there and to host others, that will become the true luxury, if it isn’t already.

I anyway never liked going on holiday. "
