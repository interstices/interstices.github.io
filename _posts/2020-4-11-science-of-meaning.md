This podcast was started in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Covering classic theories of meaning as well as current work in computation semantics, it tries to answer questions such as 'what is meaning?'. 'how do we make sense of things?', 'can we ever know we have found meaning?' 

**The author:** Aurelie Herbelot.
