Peer Press is a collective, in the simplest sense of the term. We collect what we do (mostly writings, but other things too) and share it on this site. There is no higher purpose to the endeavour, just the feeling of belonging together and the need to record that no matter how heterogeneous our output might seem, it probably wouldn't exist without the connections between us.

Who is that 'us'? Many different people, who are acknowledged in various parts of the site. Long-standing members are listed below.

A.H. is a researcher in computational linguistics at the Center for Mind/Brain sciences, University of Trento (Italy). Her research group is CALM (Computational Approaches to Language and Meaning). She has a certain obsession for stories of gods-and-other-beasts creating worlds, and thus a predilection for truth-theoretic semantics. She would rather not be contacted, but if you really have to, you can find her details at [https://aurelieherbelot.net](https://aurelieherbelot.net).
